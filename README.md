UP!
==
This project is about an interactive, entertaining phone experience through collaboration. The <em>UP!</em> gives people a virtual experience to lift a house up just like <a href="http://adisney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/up/">Disney/Pixar’s Up animation</a>. Users can easily participate in the project everywhere only by giving a phone call. A call generates a balloon with a unique color and the last 4-digit of the phone number so that users can see which balloon is theirs. Users can inflate their balloon by blowing the air on the phone. But the balloon has a limited volume and it will pop if the user blows too much air in the balloon. So users can play with blowing up the balloon. Finally, the house starts to be flying in the air when the amount of the air of balloons is enough to lift it up. Not an individual can do it but it comes true through collaboration.
